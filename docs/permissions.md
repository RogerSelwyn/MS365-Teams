## Changing Features and Permissions
If you decide to enable new features in the integration, or decide to change from read only to read/write, you will very likely get a warning message similar to the following in your logs.

`Minimum required permissions not granted: ['Chat.Read', ['Chat.ReadWrite']]`

You will need to delete as detailed on the [token page](./token.md)
